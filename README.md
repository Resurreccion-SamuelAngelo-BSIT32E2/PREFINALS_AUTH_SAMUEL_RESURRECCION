Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

Separation of Concerns: The architecture isolates business logic from infrastructure concerns, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
Testability: Clear separation allows for easier unit testing of individual components in isolation.
Flexibility: Changes in one layer typically don't affect other layers, promoting easier maintenance and updates.
Scalability: The layered structure can accommodate new features as the application grows without requiring drastic changes.
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
yes
 
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
